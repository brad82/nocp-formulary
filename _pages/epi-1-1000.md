## Generic Name

epinephrine 1:1,000

## Trade Name

Adrenalin

## Classification

Sympathomimetic agonist, hormone

## Indications

- Severe anaphylaxis
- Status asthmaticus (_ALS only_)
- Severe reactive airway disease (_ALS only_)

## Contraindications

- None in an emergency situation
- Hypovolemic shock

## Precautions

- Epiglottitis
- Should be protected from light

It can be deactivated by alkaline solutions such as sodium bicarbonate and furosemide and therefore the IV line must be flushed between the administration of epinephrine and sodium bicarbonate

Sympathomimetics and phosphodiesterase inhibitors may exacerbate dysrhythmia response.

MAO inhibitors may potentiate the effects of epinephrine.

Uncorrected tachyarrhythmias

Shock

Use lower dose in elderly or cardiac patients

## Side Effects

- Palpitations
- Chest pain or discomfort
- Anxiety
- Hypertension
- Dyspnea
- Tremors

- EpiPen 0.3 mg,
- EpiPen JR 0.15mg

Ampule: 1mg in 1mL  
Multi-dose: 30mg in 30m

## Mechanism

Epinephrine works by binding to **α** and **ß** adrenergic receptors causing a stimulant response.

The most prominent actions are on the **ß** receptors of the heart, vascular and other smooth muscle. 20% **α** and 80% **ß**.

Epinephrine relaxes the smooth muscles of the bronchi and is a physiologic antagonist of histamine, therefore reversing Histamine's effects

Rapid IV injection produces a rapid rise in blood pressure, mainly systolic by direct stimulation of the cardiac müscle which increases the ventricular contraction. (ALS only).

Increased systemic vascular resistance\
\+ Chronotropic effects\
\+ Inotropic effects\
\+ Dromotropic effects

- Onset in 3 - 10 min SQ/IM, < 2 min IV/ETT
- Peak effects within 20 min SQ/IM, < 5 min IV/ETT
- Duration of 20 - 30 min SQ/IM, < 5-10 min IV/ETT
- ½ life of 3 - 5 min depending on rate of vasoconstriction which could delay the absorption rate

## Notes

Monitor vitals continually.
