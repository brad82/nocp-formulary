## Mechanism

Once digested ASA causes changes to the surfaces of platelets decreasing its effectiveness in clot formation.

It blocks formation of thromboxane A2, which causes platelets to aggregate and arteries to constrict in the clotting cascade. This change lasts as long as the platelet is in circulation (5 - 7 days).

- Onset in 5-30 min
- Peak effects within 15-120 min
- Duration of 1-4 hours
- ½ life of 15-20 min

## Notes

Should be given as soon as possible to patients with ACS or cardiac chest pain indications.

It also appears to reduce the rate of nonfatal reinfaction and nonfatal stroke
