## Mechanism

Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication.

Ibuprofen inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cycloxygenase isoenzymes, resulting in its analgesic, anti-inflammatory and anti-pyretic effects.

Unlike narcotics, which act on the CNS, ibuprofen is considered a peripherally acting analgesic

It does not have the sedative properties of the narcotic class of medications

- Onset in 30-60min
- Peak effects within 1 - 2 hours
- Duration of 6 - 8 hours
- ½ life of 2 - 4 hours

## Notes

Ibuprofen, when administered with other NSAIDs, including Aspirin, can worsen the side effects associated with the use of the medications in this class.

Ibuprofen is best taken with food to avoid any GI issues.
