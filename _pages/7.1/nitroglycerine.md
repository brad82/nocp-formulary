## Mechanism

Nitroglycerin is a rapid smooth muscle relaxant that causes peripheral vasodilation of blood vessels and decreases return to the heart (preload), to a lesser extent on the afterload.

This decreases the workload of the cardiac muscle, hence decreasing myocardial oxygen demand and as a result improves the perfusion to the ischemic myocardium

Nitroglycerin is lipid soluble and is thought to enter the body from the GI tract through the lymphatics rather than the portal blood
