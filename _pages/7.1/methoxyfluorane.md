## Mechanism

Once digested ASA causes changes to the surfaces of platelets decreasing its effectiveness in clot formation.

It blocks formation of thromboxane A2, which causes platelets to aggregate and arteries to constrict in the clotting cascade. This change lasts as long as the platelet is in circulation (5 - 7 days).
