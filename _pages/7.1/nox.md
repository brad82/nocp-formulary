## Mechanism

Nitrous oxide is a CNS depressant with potent analgesic and weak anesthetic properties.

The effects of Entonox® take place within the CNS and are related to the release of endogenous neurotransmitters such as opioid peptides and serotonin and is responsible for the activation of certain opioid receptors.

Entonox® is said to work with the gray area of the midbrain where the opioid peptides are released.

Entonox® is a mixture of 50% oxygen and 50% nitrous oxide.
