The mechanism is not exactly known, however, it is believed the following:

Interferes with the release and re-uptake of neurotransmitters at post-synaptic terminals.

Alters ionic conductance following receptor activation by a neurotransmitter, thereby disrupting neuronal transmission.

In addition, this agent activates the inhibitory receptor gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
