## Supplied

1mg powder with 1mL solute (needs to be reconstituted)

## Mechanism

Glucagon is a naturally occurring hormone released by the pancreas.
When released it enters the liver causing a breakdown of glycogen stores into glucose.
It also inhibits the synthesis of glucose into glycogen.
Glucagon binds to receptors on the cells membrane causing an increase of cyclic AMP (cAMP).
The increase in cAMP helps to facilitate calcium into the cells causing increased heart rate and inotropic response and decreases renal vascular resistance.

This response is the desired effect when given for a β-blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose

- Onset in 5-10 min
- Peak effects are variable based on patient's condition, approximately 30 min
- Duration of 1-2 hours
- ½ life is variable based on the patient's condition

## Notes

Patients must have adequate glycogen stores in the liver for glucagon to be effective

May have decreased to no effect on malnourished individuals

Avoid shaking after reconstitution as the medication will foam and delay administration time

Glucagon should not be considered as a first-line treatment for hyperglycemia

Blood pressure is decreased due to the diminished sympathetic tone secondary to a significantly improved cardiac output and may occur immediately or up to two hours after IV administration.
