## Mechanism

Naloxone is a competitive narcotic antagonist.

It competes for narcotic receptors in the brain and it can also displace narcotic molecules from the receptors.

It can be used to treat narcotics and synthetic narcotic agents.

- Onset in < 2min IV/IO, 2-10 min IM/ETT\*
- Peak effects within < 2 min IV/IO, 2-10 min IM/ETT\*
- Duration of 20-120 min
- ½ life of 60-90 min

## Notes

Higher doses of 10-20mg may be required for overdoses of synthetic narcotics. Narcan has no real effect when given when narcotics are not present.

Should be used in caution in the case of polypharmacy overdoses, though respiratory depression usually the largest issue for administration.
