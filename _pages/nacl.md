## Generic Name

0.9% Sodium Chloride

## Trade Name

NaCL

## Classification

Isotonic crystalloid solution

## Indications

- Hypovolemia
- Heat related problems
- Freshwater drowning
- Diabetic ketoacidosis
- TKVO
- Medication route

## Contraindications

Left sided CHF including coarse crackles (rales or rhonci) in lungs. May cause additional fluid overload if administered in large enough volumes

## Precautions

Normal saline only contains sodium and chloride

When large amounts of normal saline are administered, it is quite possible for other physiological electrolytes to become depleted.

In cases where large amounts of fluids may have to be administered, it might be prudent to use lactated Ringers solution.

## Side effects

Rare if used within the required theraputic dosages

May cause circulatory overload for cardiovascular compromosed patients (CHF)

## Dose

### Resuscitation

Adult:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;20mL/kg to a max of 3L and/or titrate to:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 80-90 Systolic for suspected Abdominal Bleeds  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- 100-110 systolic for Traumatic Brain Injuries

Pediatric:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;20mL/kg to a max of 3 times as per PEARS

### TKVO

Adult: 60mL/hr  
Pediatric: 60mL/hr

## Supplied

Various volumes: 1mL, 2mL, 10mL, 50mL, 100mL, 250mL, 500mL, 1000mL

## Mechanism

Normal saline replaces water and electrolytes

Normal saline contains 154mEq/L of sodium (Na⁺) ions, and approximately 154mEq/L of Chloride (CL⁻) ions.

Because the concentration of Na+ is near that of blood, the solution is isotonic.

- Onset in 1 - 2min
- Peak effects within 2 - 6 min
- Duration is 30 - 60 min
- ½ life of 20 - 40 min

## Notes
